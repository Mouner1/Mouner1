### :man_technologist: About Me :

I'm a recent graduate from the University of Guelph with a degree in Engineering Systems and Computing, passionate about building scalable, impactful software. I enjoy working across the full stack, solving real-world problems, and continuously learning new technologies.

🧠 Co-op Experience: Worked at Fidelity Investments and the Ontario Ministry of Government and Consumer Services, where I developed automation tools, internal web applications, and chatbot solutions using Python, C#, SQL, Power Platform, and OpenAI APIs.

💡 Research Background: Contributed to a real-time motion tracking system as a Research Assistant using C++ and Unity for a virtual rehab tool.

⚙️ What I’m Building: A chess game built with React and TypeScript, along with full-stack tools that explore APIs, cloud integrations, and responsive design.

🌱 Currently Learning: Deepening my knowledge in backend systems, cloud platforms (AWS/Azure), and DevOps practices to build scalable, testable applications.
